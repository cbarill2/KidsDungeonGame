# Simple Dungeon Game
A tile-based, turn-based RPG with simple mechanics to digitize tabletop gaming for kids. It will feature a procedurally generated game board with monsters to defeat, prisoners to rescue, and treasure to collect.

### Functional Features
- Procedurally-generated game board and enemies
- Players click highlighted tiles to move, click highlighted enemies to attack
- "Rollable" dice (drag-and-drop to get a result)
- "Programmer Art" with simple animations

### Planned Features
- Add leveling system
- Add collectible items
- Simple enemy AI (enemies will at least move toward players and fight back)
- Multiple enemy difficulty levels
- Better procedural generation (the door and enemy placement are _pretty_ dumb right now)
- Menus/UI, Sounds, Better Art
